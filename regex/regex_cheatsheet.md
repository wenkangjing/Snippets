RegEx Cheat Sheet
====================

In the following tables, unescaped a, b, and z characters are used to denote regular characters (letters, digits, punctuation), while unescaped p and q characters are used to denote patterns (each pattern may be arbitrarily complex). Other characters should be taken literally.

## Basic Matching

Pattern |	Meaning
- /a/	Match the character a
- /\?/, /\./	Match a meta-character literally
- /\n/, /\t/	Match a control character (newline, tab, etc)
- /pq/	Concatenation (p followed by q)
- /(p)/	Capturing Group
- `/(p	q)/`
- /p/i	Case insensitive match


## Character Classes and Shortcuts

Pattern	| Meaning
- /[ab]/	a or b
- /[a-z]/	a through z, inclusive
- /[^ab]/	Not (a or b)
- /[^a-z]/	Not (a through z)
- /./	Any character except newline
- /\s/, /[\s]/	Whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc)
- /\S/, /[\S]/	Not a whitespace character
- /\d/, /[\d]/	Decimal digit (0-9)
- /\D/, /[\D]/	Not a decimal digit
- /\w/, /[\w]/	Word character (0-9, a-z, A-Z, _)
- /\W/, /[\W]/	Not a word character


## Anchors

Pattern	| Meaning
- /^p/	Pattern at start of line
- /p$/	Pattern at end of line
- /\Ap/	Pattern at start of string
- /p\z/	Pattern at end of string (after newline)
- /p\Z/	Pattern at end of string (before newline)
- /\bp/	Pattern begins at word boundary
- /p\b/	Pattern ends at word boundary
- /\Bp/	Pattern begins at non-word boundary
- /p\B/	Pattern ends at non-word boundary

## Quantifiers

Pattern	| Meaning
- /p*/	0 or more occurrences of pattern
- /p+/	1 or more occurrences of pattern
- /p?/	0 or 1 occurrence of pattern
- /p{m}/	m occurrences of pattern
- /p{m,}/	m or more occurrences of pattern
- /p{m,n}/	m through n occurrences of pattern
- /p*?/	0 or more occurrences (lazy)
- /p+?/	1 or more occurrences (lazy)
- /p??/	0 or 1 occurrence (lazy)
- /p{m,}?/	m or more occurrences (lazy)
- /p{m,n}?/	m through n occurrences (lazy)
