3019	1033	16	0	The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' is from a previous interrupted RESTORE operation and is inconsistent with the current RESTORE command. The restart command must use the same syntax as the interrupted command, with the addition of the RESTART clause. Alternatively, reissue the current statement without the RESTART clause.
3021	1033	16	0	Cannot perform a backup or restore operation within a transaction.
3022	1033	10	0	This backup is a file backup of read-write data from a database that uses the simple recovery model. This is only appropriate if you plan to set the filegroup to read-only followed by a differential file backup. Consult Books Online for more information on managing read-only data for the simple recovery model. In particular, consider how partial backups are used.
3023	1033	16	0	Backup, file manipulation operations (such as ALTER DATABASE ADD FILE) and encryption changes on a database must be serialized. Reissue the statement after the current backup or file manipulation operation is completed.
3024	1033	16	0	You can only perform a full backup of the master database. Use BACKUP DATABASE to back up the entire master database.
3025	1033	16	0	Missing database name. Reissue the statement specifying a valid database name.
3027	1033	16	0	The filegroup "%.*ls" is not part of database "%.*ls".
3028	1033	10	0	The restart-checkpoint file '%ls' was corrupted and is being ignored. The RESTORE command will continue from the beginning as if RESTART had not been specified.

3035	1033	16	0	Cannot perform a differential backup for database "%ls", because a current database backup does not exist. Perform a full database backup by reissuing BACKUP DATABASE, omitting the WITH DIFFERENTIAL option.
3036	1033	16	0	The database "%ls" is in warm-standby state (set by executing RESTORE WITH STANDBY) and cannot be backed up until the entire restore sequence is completed.
3038	1033	16	0	The file name "%ls" is invalid as a backup device name. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid file name.
3039	1033	16	0	Cannot perform a differential backup for file '%ls' because a current file backup does not exist. Reissue BACKUP DATABASE omitting the WITH DIFFERENTIAL option.
3040	1033	10	0	An error occurred while informing replication of the backup. The backup will continue, but the replication environment should be inspected.
3041	1033	16	1	BACKUP failed to complete the command %.*ls. Check the backup application log for detailed messages.
3042	1033	10	0	BACKUP WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR successfully generated a backup of the damaged database. Refer to the SQL Server error log for information about the errors that were encountered.
3043	1033	16	0	BACKUP '%ls' detected an error on page (%d:%d) in file '%ls'.
3044	1033	16	0	Invalid zero-length device name. Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid device name.
3045	1033	16	0	BACKUP or RESTORE requires the NTFS file system for FILESTREAM and full-text support. The path "%.*ls" is not usable.
3046	1033	16	0	Inconsistent metadata has been encountered. The only possible backup operation is a tail-log backup using the WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR or NO_TRUNCATE option.
3047	1033	16	0	The BackupDirectory registry key is not configured correctly. This key should specify the root path where disk backup files are stored when full path names are not provided. This path is also used to locate restart checkpoint files for RESTORE.
3049	1033	16	0	BACKUP detected corruption in the database log. Check the errorlog for more information.
3050	1033	16	0	SQL Server could not send the differential information for database file '%ls' of database '%ls\\%ls' to the backup application because the differential information is too large to fit in memory, and an attempt to use a temporary file has failed.
3051	1033	16	0	BACKUP LOG was unable to maintain mirroring consistency for database '%ls'. Database mirroring has been suspended.
3054	1033	16	0	Differential file backups can include only read-only data for databases using the simple recovery model. Consider taking a partial backup by specifying READ_WRITE_FILEGROUPS.
3055	1033	16	0	Backup destination "%.*ls" supports a FILESTREAM filegroup. This filegroup cannot be used as a backup destination. Rerun the BACKUP statement with a valid backup destination.
3056	1033	16	0	The backup operation has detected an unexpected file in a FILESTREAM container. The backup operation will continue and include file '%ls'.
3057	1033	16	0	Invalid device name. The length of the device name provided exceeds supported limit (maximum length is:%d). Reissue the BACKUP statement with a valid device name.
3058	1033	10	0	File or device name exceeds the supported limit (maximum length is:%d) and will be truncated: %.*ls.
3098	1033	16	0	The backup cannot be performed because '%ls' was requested after the media was formatted with an incompatible structure. To append to this media set, either omit '%ls' or specify '%ls'. Alternatively, you can create a new media set by using WITH FORMAT in your BACKUP statement. If you use WITH FORMAT on an existing media set, all its backup sets will be overwritten.
3101	1033	16	0	Exclusive access could not be obtained because the database is in use.
3102	1033	16	0	%ls cannot process database '%ls' because it is in use by this session. It is recommended that the master database be used when performing this operation.
3103	1033	16	0	A partial restore sequence cannot be initiated by this command. To initiate a partial restore sequence, use the WITH PARTIAL clause of the RESTORE statement and provide a backup set which includes a full copy of at least the primary data file. The WITH PARTIAL clause of the RESTORE statement may not be used for any other purpose.
3104	1033	16	0	RESTORE cannot operate on database '%ls' because it is configured for database mirroring. Use ALTER DATABASE to remove mirroring if you intend to restore the database.
3105	1033	16	0	RESTORE cannot restore any more pages into file '%ls' because the maximum number of pages (%d) are already being restored. Either complete the restore sequence for the existing pages, or use RESTORE FILE to restore all pages in the file.
3106	1033	16	0	The filegroup "%ls" is ambiguous. The identity in the backup set does not match the filegroup that is currently defined in the online database. To force the use of the filegroup in the backup set, take the database offline and then reissue the RESTORE command.
3107	1033	16	0	The file "%ls" is ambiguous. The identity in the backup set does not match the file that is currently defined in the online database. To force the use of the file in the backup set, take the database offline and then reissue the RESTORE command.
3108	1033	16	0	To restore the master database, the server must be running in single-user mode. For information on starting in single-user mode, see "How to: Start an Instance of SQL Server (sqlservr.exe)" in Books Online.
3109	1033	16	0	Master can only be restored and fully recovered in a single step using a full database backup. Options such as NORECOVERY, STANDBY, and STOPAT are not supported.
3110	1033	14	0	User does not have permission to RESTORE database '%.*ls'.
3111	1033	16	0	Page %S_PGID is a control page which cannot be restored in isolation. To repair this page, the entire file must be restored.
3112	1033	16	0	Cannot restore any database other than master when the server is in single user mode.
3113	1033	16	0	Invalid data was detected.
3115	1033	16	0	The database is using the simple recovery model. It is not possible to restore a subset of the read-write data.
3116	1033	16	0	The supplied backup is not on the same recovery path as the database, and is ineligible for use for an online file restore.
3117	1033	16	0	The log or differential backup cannot be restored because no files are ready to rollforward.
3118	1033	16	0	The database "%ls" does not exist. RESTORE can only create a database when restoring either a full backup or a file backup of the primary file.
3119	1033	16	0	Problems were identified while planning for the RESTORE statement. Previous messages provide details.
3120	1033	16	0	This backup set will not be restored because all data has already been restored to a point beyond the time covered by this backup set.
3121	1033	16	0	The file "%ls" is on a recovery path that is inconsistent with application of this backup set. RESTORE cannot continue.
3122	1033	16	0	File initialization failed. RESTORE cannot continue.
3123	1033	16	0	Invalid database name '%.*ls' specified for backup or restore operation.
3125	1033	16	0	The database is using the simple recovery model. The data in the backup it is not consistent with the current state of the database. Restoring more data is required before recovery is possible. Either restore a full file backup taken since the data was marked read-only, or restore the most recent base backup for the target data followed by a differential file backup.
3127	1033	16	1	The file '%.*ls' of restored database '%ls' is being left in the defunct state because the database is using the simple recovery model and the file is marked for read-write access. Therefore, only read-only files can be recovered by piecemeal restore.
3128	1033	16	0	File '%ls' has an unsupported page size (%d).
3129	1033	16	0	The contents of the file "%ls" are not consistent with a transition into the restore sequence. A restore from a backup set may be required.
3130	1033	10	0	The filegroup "%ls" is selected. At the time of backup it was known by the name "%ls"'. RESTORE will continue operating upon the renamed filegroup.
3131	1033	10	0	The file "%ls" is selected. At the time of backup it was known by the name "%ls". RESTORE will continue operating upon the renamed file.
3132	1033	16	0	The media set has %d media families but only %d are provided. All members must be provided.
3133	1033	16	0	The volume on device "%ls" is sequence number %d of media family %d, but sequence number %d of media family %d is expected. Check that the device specifications and loaded media are correct.
3134	1033	10	1	The differential base attribute for file '%ls' of database '%ls' has been reset because the file has been restored from a backup taken on a conflicting recovery path. The restore was allowed because the file was read-only and was consistent with the current status of the database. Any future differential backup of this file will require a new differential base.
3135	1033	16	0	The backup set in file '%ls' was created by %hs and cannot be used for this restore operation.
3136	1033	16	0	This differential backup cannot be restored because the database has not been restored to the correct earlier state.
3137	1033	16	0	Database cannot be reverted. Either the primary or the snapshot names are improperly specified, all other snapshots have not been dropped, or there are missing files.
3138	1033	16	0	The database cannot be reverted because FILESTREAM BLOBs are present.
3139	1033	16	0	Restore to snapshot is not allowed with the master database.
3140	1033	16	0	Could not adjust the space allocation for file '%ls'.
3141	1033	16	0	The database to be restored was named '%ls'. Reissue the statement using the WITH REPLACE option to overwrite the '%ls' database.
3142	1033	16	0	File "%ls" cannot be restored over the existing "%ls". Reissue the RESTORE statement using WITH REPLACE to overwrite pre-existing files, or WITH MOVE to identify an alternate location.

3144	1033	16	0	File '%.*ls' was not backed up in file %d on device '%ls'. The file cannot be restored from this backup set.
3145	1033	16	0	The STOPAT option is not supported for databases that use the SIMPLE recovery model.
3147	1033	16	0	Backup and restore operations are not allowed on database tempdb.
3148	1033	16	0	This RESTORE statement is invalid in the current context. The 'Recover Data Only' option is only defined for secondary filegroups when the database is in an online state. When the database is in an offline state filegroups cannot be specified.
3149	1033	16	0	The file or filegroup "%ls" is not in a valid state for the "Recover Data Only" option to be used. Only secondary files in the OFFLINE or RECOVERY_PENDING state can be processed.
3150	1033	10	0	The master database has been successfully restored. Shutting down SQL Server.
3151	1033	21	1	Failed to restore master database. Shutting down SQL Server. Check the error logs, and rebuild the master database. For more information about how to rebuild the master database, see SQL Server Books Online.
3153	1033	16	0	The database is already fully recovered.
3154	1033	16	0	The backup set holds a backup of a database other than the existing '%ls' database.
3155	1033	16	0	The RESTORE operation cannot proceed because one or more files have been added or dropped from the database since the backup set was created.
3156	1033	16	0	File '%ls' cannot be restored to '%ls'. Use WITH MOVE to identify a valid location for the file.
3159	1033	16	0	The tail of the log for the database "%ls" has not been backed up. Use BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY to backup the log if it contains work you do not want to lose. Use the WITH REPLACE or WITH STOPAT clause of the RESTORE statement to just overwrite the contents of the log.
3161	1033	16	0	The primary file is unavailable. It must be restored or otherwise made available.
3163	1033	16	0	The transaction log was damaged. All data files must be restored before RESTORE LOG can be attempted.
3165	1033	16	0	Database '%ls' was restored, however an error was encountered while replication was being restored/removed. The database has been left offline. See the topic MSSQL_ENG003165 in SQL Server Books Online.
3166	1033	16	0	RESTORE DATABASE could not drop database '%ls'. Drop the database and then reissue the RESTORE DATABASE statement.
3167	1033	16	0	RESTORE could not start database '%ls'.
3168	1033	16	0	The backup of the system database on the device %ls cannot be restored because it was created by a different version of the server (%ls) than this server (%ls).
3169	1033	16	0	The database was backed up on a server running version %ls. That version is incompatible with this server, which is running version %ls. Either restore the database on a server that supports the backup, or use a backup that is compatible with this server.
3170	1033	16	0	The STANDBY filename is invalid.
3171	1033	16	0	File %ls is defunct and cannot be restored into the online database.
3172	1033	16	0	Filegroup %ls is defunct and cannot be restored into the online database.
3173	1033	16	0	The STOPAT clause provided with this RESTORE statement indicates that the tail of the log contains changes that must be backed up to reach the target point in time. The tail of the log for the database "%ls" has not been backed up. Use BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY to back up the log, or use the WITH REPLACE clause in your RESTORE statement to overwrite the tail of the log.
3174	1033	16	0	The file '%ls' cannot be moved by this RESTORE operation.
3175	1033	10	0	RESTORE FILEGROUP="%ls" was specified, but not all of its files are present in the backup set. File "%ls" is missing. RESTORE will continue, but if you want all files to be restored, you must restore other backup sets.
3176	1033	16	0	File '%ls' is claimed by '%ls'(%d) and '%ls'(%d). The WITH MOVE clause can be used to relocate one or more files.

3179	1033	16	0	The system database cannot be moved by RESTORE.
3180	1033	16	0	This backup cannot be restored using WITH STANDBY because a database upgrade is needed. Reissue the RESTORE without WITH STANDBY.
3181	1033	10	0	Attempting to restore this backup may encounter storage space problems. Subsequent messages will provide details.
3182	1033	16	0	The backup set cannot be restored because the database was damaged when the backup occurred. Salvage attempts may exploit WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR.
3183	1033	16	0	RESTORE detected an error on page (%d:%d) in database "%ls" as read from the backup set.
3184	1033	10	0	RESTORE WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR was successful but some damage was encountered. Inconsistencies in the database are possible.

3190	1033	16	0	Filegroup '%ls' cannot be restored because it does not exist in the backup set.
3191	1033	16	0	Restore cannot continue because file '%ls' cannot be written. Ensure that all files in the database are writable.
3192	1033	10	0	Restore was successful but deferred transactions remain. These transactions cannot be resolved because there are data that is unavailable. Either use RESTORE to make that data available or drop the filegroups if you never need this data again. Dropping the filegroup results in a defunct filegroup.
3194	1033	16	0	Page %S_PGID is beyond the end of the file. Only pages that are in the current range of the file can be restored.
3195	1033	16	0	Page %S_PGID cannot be restored from this backup set. RESTORE PAGE can only be used from full backup sets or from the first log or differential backup taken since the file was added to the database.

3957	1033	16	0	Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the database did not allow snapshot isolation when the current transaction started. It may help to retry the transaction.
3958	1033	16	0	Transaction aborted when accessing versioned row in table '%.*ls' in database '%.*ls'. Requested versioned row was not found. Your tempdb is probably out of space. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.
3959	1033	10	1	Version store is full. New version(s) could not be added. A transaction that needs to access the version store may be rolled back. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.
3960	1033	16	0	Snapshot isolation transaction aborted due to update conflict. You cannot use snapshot isolation to access table '%.*ls' directly or indirectly in database '%.*ls' to update, delete, or insert the row that has been modified or deleted by another transaction. Retry the transaction or change the isolation level for the update/delete statement.
3961	1033	16	0	Snapshot isolation transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because the object accessed by the statement has been modified by a DDL statement in another concurrent transaction since the start of this transaction.  It is disallowed because the metadata is not versioned. A concurrent update to metadata can lead to inconsistency if mixed with snapshot isolation.
3962	1033	16	0	Bind to another transaction while executing SQL Server internal query is not supported. Check your logon trigger definition and remove any sp_bindsession usage if any. If this error is not happening during logon trigger execution, contact production support team.
3963	1033	16	0	Transaction failed in database '%.*ls' because distributed transactions are not supported under snapshot isolation.
3964	1033	16	0	Transaction failed because this DDL statement is not allowed inside a snapshot isolation transaction. Since metadata is not versioned, a metadata change can lead to inconsistency if mixed within snapshot isolation.
3965	1033	16	0	The PROMOTE TRANSACTION request failed because there is no local transaction active.
3966	1033	17	0	Transaction is rolled back when accessing version store. It was earlier marked as victim when the version store was shrunk due to insufficient space in tempdb. This transaction was marked as a victim earlier because it may need the row version(s) that have already been removed to make space in tempdb. Retry the transaction
3967	1033	17	1	Insufficient space in tempdb to hold row versions.  Need to shrink the version store to free up some space in tempdb. Transaction (id=%I64d xsn=%I64d spid=%d elapsed_time=%d) has been marked as victim and it will be rolled back if it accesses the version store. If the problem persists, the likely cause is improperly sized tempdb or long running transactions. Please refer to BOL on how to configure tempdb for versioning.
3968	1033	10	0	Snapshot isolation or read committed snapshot is not available in database '%.*ls' because SQL Server was started with one or more undocumented trace flags that prevent enabling database for versioning. Transaction started with snapshot isolation will fail and a query running under read committed snapshot will succeed but will resort back to lock based read committed.

4318	1033	16	0	File '%ls' has been rolled forward to LSN %.*ls. This log terminates at LSN %.*ls, which is too early to apply the WITH RECOVERY option. Reissue the RESTORE LOG statement WITH NORECOVERY.
4319	1033	16	0	A previous restore operation was interrupted and did not complete processing on file '%ls'. Either restore the backup set that was interrupted or restart the restore sequence.
4320	1033	16	0	The file "%ls" was not fully restored by a database or file restore. The entire file must be successfully restored before applying this backup set.
4322	1033	10	0	This backup set contains records that were logged before the designated point in time. The database is being left in the restoring state so that more roll forward can be performed.
4323	1033	16	0	A previous RESTORE WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR operation left the database in a potentially damaged state. To continue this RESTORE sequence, all further steps must include the CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR option.
4326	1033	16	0	The log in this backup set terminates at LSN %.*ls, which is too early to apply to the database. A more recent log backup that includes LSN %.*ls can be restored.
4327	1033	16	0	The log in this backup set contains bulk-logged changes. Point-in-time recovery was inhibited. The database has been rolled forward to the end of the log.
4328	1033	16	0	The file "%ls" is missing. Roll forward stops at log sequence number %.*ls. The file is created at log sequence number (LSN) %.*ls, dropped at LSN %.*ls. Restore the transaction log beyond the point in time when the file was dropped, or restore data to be consistent with rest of the database.
4329	1033	10	0	This log file contains records logged before the designated mark. The database is being left in the Restoring state so you can apply another log file.
4330	1033	16	0	This backup set cannot be applied because it is on a recovery path that is inconsistent with the database. The recovery path is the sequence of data and log backups that have brought the database to a particular recovery point. Find a compatible backup to restore, or restore the rest of the database to match a recovery point within this backup set, which will restore the database to a different point in time.  For more information about recovery paths, see SQL Server Books Online.
4331	1033	16	0	The database cannot be recovered because the files have been restored to inconsistent points in time.
4332	1033	16	0	RESTORE LOG has been halted. To use the database in its current state, run RESTORE DATABASE %ls WITH RECOVERY.
4333	1033	16	0	The database cannot be recovered because the log was not restored.
4334	1033	16	0	The named mark does not identify a valid LSN.
4335	1033	16	0	The specified STOPAT time is too early. All or part of the database is already rolled forward beyond that point.
4336	1033	16	0	The filegroup "%ls" has been dropped and cannot be restored into the online database.
4337	1033	16	0	The file "%ls" has been dropped and cannot be restored into the online database.
4338	1033	16	0	The STOPAT clause specifies a point too early to allow this backup set to be restored. Choose a different stop point or use RESTORE DATABASE WITH RECOVERY to recover at the current point.
4339	1033	10	0	This RESTORE statement successfully performed some actions, but the database could not be brought online because one or more RESTORE steps are needed. Previous messages indicate reasons why recovery cannot occur at this point.
4340	1033	16	0	The point-in-time clause of this RESTORE statement is restricted for use by RESTORE LOG statements only. Omit the clause or use a clause that includes a timestamp.
4341	1033	16	0	This log backup contains bulk-logged changes. It cannot be used to stop at an arbitrary point in time.
4342	1033	16	0	Point-in-time recovery is not possible unless the primary filegroup is part of the restore sequence. Omit the point-in-time clause or restore the primary filegroup.
4343	1033	16	0	The database has been rolled forward to the end of this backup set and beyond the specified point in time. RESTORE WITH RECOVERY can be used to accept the current recovery point.
4344	1033	16	0	RESTORE PAGE is not allowed on read-only databases or filegroups.
4345	1033	10	0	Problems recording information in the msdb..suspect_pages table were encountered. This error does not interfere with any activity except maintenance of the suspect_pages table. Check the error log for more information.
4346	1033	16	0	RESTORE PAGE is not allowed with databases that use the simple recovery model.
4347	1033	16	0	The current restore sequence was previously interrupted during the transition to the online state. RESTORE DATABASE WITH RECOVERY can be used to complete the transition to online.
4348	1033	16	0	The online restore to database '%ls' failed. It may be appropriate to perform an offline restore instead. An offline restore is initiated by using BACKUP LOG WITH NORECOVERY.
4349	1033	16	0	The log in this backup set begins at LSN %.*ls, which is too recent to apply to the database. This restore sequence needs to initialize the log to start at LSN %.*ls. Reissue the RESTORE LOG statement using an earlier log backup.
4350	1033	16	0	The list of pages provided with the RESTORE PAGE statement is incorrectly formatted. Prior to the problem %d pages were correctly identified. The problem was hit at character offset %d. Check that all pages are identified by numeric <file>:<page> pairs with commas separating each pair.  For example: PAGE='1:57,2:31'.
4351	1033	16	0	Backups taken on earlier versions of SQL Server are not supported by fn_dump_dblog.
4352	1033	16	0	RESTORE LOG is not supported from this data backup because file '%ls' is too old. Use a regular log backup to continue the restore sequence.
4353	1033	16	0	Conflicting file relocations have been specified for file '%.*ls'. Only a single WITH MOVE clause should be specified for any logical file name.
4354	1033	10	1	The file '%.*ls' of restored database '%ls' is being left in the defunct state because the database is being upgraded from a prior version. Piecemeal restore is not supported when an upgrade is involved.
4355	1033	16	0	The revert command is incorrectly specified. The RESTORE statement must be of the form: RESTORE DATABASE <x> FROM DATABASE_SNAPSHOT = <y>.
4356	1033	10	0	Restore is complete on database '%ls'.  The database is now available.
4357	1033	16	0	Restore cannot take '%ls' offline because changes exist that require a log backup. Take a log backup and then retry the RESTORE.
4358	1033	16	0	The database can not be brought online because file '%ls' is currently restored to LSN %.*ls but must be restored to LSN %.*ls.
4359	1033	16	0	The STOPAT option cannot be used with this partial restore sequence because one or more FILESTREAM filegroups are not included. The CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR option can be used to force the recovery, but this should only be used if you do not intend to subsequently restore the FILESTREAM filegroups.
4360	1033	16	0	RESTORE LOG WITH CONTINUE_AFTER_ERROR was unsuccessful. Execution of the RESTORE command was aborted.

The total requirement of %I64d KB for DOP of %lu is greater than the sp_configure value of %lu KB set for the advanced server configuration option "index create memory (KB)".  Increase this setting or reduce DOP and rerun the query.
8607	1033	16	0	The table '%.*ls' cannot be modified because one or more non-clustered indexes reside in a filegroup which is not online.
8608	1033	16	0	 The query could not be completed due to an online index build operation and must be recompiled.
8616	1033	10	0	The index hints for table '%.*ls' were ignored because the table was considered a fact table in the star join.
8618	1033	16	0	The query processor could not produce a query plan because a worktable is required, and its minimum row size exceeds the maximum allowable of %d bytes. A typical reason why a worktable is required is a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause in the query. If the query has a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause, consider reducing the number and/or size of the fields in the clause. Consider using prefix (LEFT()) or hash (CHECKSUM()) of fields for grouping or prefix for ordering. Note however that this will change the behavior of the query.
8619	1033	16	0	The query processor could not produce a query plan because a worktable is required, and its minimum row size exceeds the maximum allowable of %d bytes. A typical reason why a worktable is required is a GROUP BY or ORDER BY clause in the query. Resubmit your query without the ROBUST PLAN hint.
8621	1033	16	0	The query processor ran out of stack space during query optimization. Please simplify the query.
8622	1033	16	0	Query processor could not produce a query plan because of the hints defined in this query. Resubmit the query without specifying any hints and without using SET FORCEPLAN.
8623	1033	16	1	The query processor ran out of internal resources and could not produce a query plan. This is a rare event and only expected for extremely complex queries or queries that reference a very large number of tables or partitions. Please simplify the query. If you believe you have received this message in error, contact Customer Support Services for more information.

8633	1033	16	0	The query processor could not produce a query plan because distributed query does not support materializing intermediate results with default in DML queries over remote sources. Try to use actual default values instead of default or split the update into multiple statements, one only containing the DEFAULT assignment, the other with the rest.
8634	1033	17	0	The query processor received an error from a cluster communication layer.
8635	1033	16	0	The query processor could not produce a query plan for a query with a spatial index hint.  Reason: %S_MSG.  Try removing the index hints or removing SET FORCEPLAN.
8636	1033	16	0	The query processor could not produce a query plan because there is a subquery in the predicate of the full outer join. This is not supported for distributed queries.
8637	1033	16	0	The query processor could not produce a query plan because a USE PLAN hint was used for a query that modifies data while the target table of the modification has an index that is currently being built online. Consider waiting until the online index build is done before forcing the plan, or using another way to tune the query, such as updating statistics, or using a different hint or a manual query rewrite.
8642	1033	17	0	The query processor could not start the necessary thread resources for parallel query execution.
8644	1033	16	0	Internal Query Processor Error: The plan selected for execution does not support the invoked given execution routine.
8645	1033	17	1	A timeout occurred while waiting for memory resources to execute the query in resource pool '%ls' (%ld). Rerun the query.
8646	1033	21	1	Unable to find index entry in index ID %d, of table %d, in database '%.*ls'. The indicated index is corrupt or there is a problem with the current update plan. Run DBCC CHECKDB or DBCC CHECKTABLE. If the problem persists, contact product support.
8648	1033	20	1	Could not insert a row larger than the page size into a hash table. Resubmit the query using the ROBUST PLAN optimization hint.
8649	1033	17	0	The query has been canceled because the estimated cost of this query (%d) exceeds the configured threshold of %d. Contact the system administrator.
8651	1033	17	0	Could not perform the operation because the requested memory grant was not available in resource pool '%ls' (%ld).  Rerun the query, reduce the query load, or check resource governor configuration setting.
8653	1033	16	0	The query processor is unable to produce a plan for the table or view '%.*ls' because the table resides in a filegroup which is not online.
8655	1033	16	0	The query processor is unable to produce a plan because the index '%.*ls' on table or view '%.*ls' is disabled.
8656	1033	16	0	The query processor could not produce a query plan. Resubmit the query after disabling trace flag %d.
8657	1033	17	0	Could not get the memory grant of %I64d KB because it exceeds the maximum configuration limit in workload group '%ls' (%ld) and resource pool '%ls' (%ld).  Contact the server administrator to increase the memory usage limit.
8660	1033	16	0	Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because the select list of the view definition does not include all columns in the GROUP BY clause. Consider adding these columns to the select list.
8661	1033	16	0	Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because the index key includes columns that are not in the GROUP BY clause. Consider eliminating columns that are not in the GROUP BY clause from the index key.
8662	1033	16	0	Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because the view references an unknown value (SUM aggregate of nullable expression). Consider referencing only non-nullable values in SUM. ISNULL() may be useful for this.
8663	1033	16	0	Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because its select list does not include COUNT_BIG(*). Consider adding COUNT_BIG(*) to the select list.
8665	1033	16	0	Cannot create the clustered index "%.*ls" on view "%.*ls" because no row can satisfy the view definition. Consider eliminating contradictions from the view definition.
8668	1033	16	0	Cannot create the clustered index '%.*ls' on view '%.*ls' because the select list of the view contains an expression on result of aggregate function or grouping column. Consider removing expression on result of aggregate function or grouping column from select list.
8669	1033	16	0	The attempt to maintain the indexed view "%.*ls" failed because it contains an expression on aggregate results, or because it contains a ranking or aggregate window function. Consider dropping the clustered index on the view, or changing the view definition.
8670	1033	16	0	Query optimizer reached the internal limit of the maximum number of views that can be used during optimization.
8671	1033	16	0	The attempt to maintain the indexed view "%.*ls" failed because of the ignore_dup_key option on index "%.*ls". Drop the index or re-create it without the ignore_dup_key index option.
8672	1033	16	0	The MERGE statement attempted to UPDATE or DELETE the same row more than once. This happens when a target row matches more than one source row. A MERGE statement cannot UPDATE/DELETE the same row of the target table multiple times. Refine the ON clause to ensure a target row matches at most one source row, or use the GROUP BY clause to group the source rows.
8673	1033	16	0	A MERGE statement is not valid if it triggers both the 'ON DELETE SET NULL' and 'ON UPDATE CASCADE' actions for a referential integrity constraint. Modify the actions performed by the MERGE statement to ensure that it does not trigger both these actions for a referential integrity constraint.
8680	1033	17	0	Internal Query Processor Error: The query processor encountered an unexpected error during the processing of a remote query phase.
8682	1033	16	0	SELECT via cursor failed because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN hint, neither Populate nor Fetch plans are provided, and at least one must be present. For best likelihood of successful plan forcing, use an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification.
8683	1033	16	0	Could not force query plan because XML showplan provided in USE PLAN hint contains invalid Star Join specification. Consider specifying a USE PLAN hint that contains an unmodified XML showplan produced by SQL Server. This may allow you to force the plan.
8684	1033	16	0	A query plan could not be found because optimizer exceeded number of allowed operations while searching for plan specified in USE PLAN hint. First consider removing USE PLAN hint. Then if necessary consider (1) updating statistics, (2) using other hints such as join hints, index hints, or the OPTIMIZE FOR hint, (3) rewriting query or breaking it down into two or more separate queries.
8685	1033	16	0	Query cannot be compiled because <CursorStmt> element appears in XML plan provided to USE PLAN but USE PLAN was applied to a non-cursor statement. Consider using an XML plan obtained from SQL Server for statement without modification.
8686	1033	16	0	Cursor plan forcing failed because input plan has more than one <Operation> node with OperationType=%ls. Consider using an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification.
8687	1033	16	0	Cursor plan failed because it is not possible to force the plan for a cursor of type other than FAST_FORWARD or STATIC with a USE PLAN hint. Consider removing USE PLAN hint and updating statistics or using different hints to influence query plan choice.
8688	1033	16	0	Cursor plan forcing failed because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN, required element %ls is missing under <CursorPlan> element. Consider using an XML cursor plan captured from SQL Server without modification.
8689	1033	16	0	Database '%.*ls', specified in the USE PLAN hint, does not exist. Specify an existing database.
8690	1033	16	0	Query cannot be compiled because USE PLAN hint conflicts with hint %ls. Consider removing hint %ls.
8691	1033	16	0	Query cannot be compiled because USE PLAN hint conflicts with SET %ls ON. Consider setting %ls OFF.
8693	1033	16	0	Cannot compile query because combination of LogicalOp = '%ls', PhysicalOp = '%ls', and sub_element = '%ls' under RelOp element in XML plan in USE PLAN hint is not valid. Use a recognized combination instead. Consider using an automatically generated XML plan without modification.
8694	1033	16	0	Cannot execute query because USE PLAN hint conflicts with use of distributed query or full-text operations. Consider removing USE PLAN hint.
8695	1033	16	0	Cannot execute query because of incorrectly formed XML plan in USE PLAN hint. Verify that XML plan is a legal plan suitable for plan forcing. See Books Online for additional details.
8696	1033	16	0	Cannot run query because of improperly formed Spool element with parent RelOp with NodeId %d in XML plan in USE PLAN hint. Verify that each Spool element's parent RelOp has unique NodeId attribute, and each Spool element has either a single RelOp sub-element, or a PrimaryNodeId attribute, but not both. PrimaryNodeId of Spool must reference NodeId of an existing RelOp with a Spool sub-element. Consider using unmodified XML showplan as USE PLAN hint.
8697	1033	16	0	Cannot run query because in XML plan provided to USE PLAN, element %ls must have %d %ls nodes as children, but has %d.
8698	1033	16	0	Query processor could not produce query plan because USE PLAN hint contains plan that could not be verified to be legal for query. Remove or replace USE PLAN hint. For best likelihood of successful plan forcing, verify that the plan provided in the USE PLAN hint is one generated automatically by SQL Server for the same query.
8699	1033	16	0	Cannot run query because it contains more than one USE PLAN hint. Use at most one USE PLAN hint.
8710	1033	16	0	Aggregate functions that are used with CUBE, ROLLUP, or GROUPING SET queries must provide for the merging of subaggregates. To fix this problem, remove the aggregate function or write the query using UNION ALL over GROUP BY clauses. 
8711	1033	16	0	Multiple ordered aggregate functions in the same scope have mutually incompatible orderings.
8712	1033	16	0	Index '%.*ls', specified in the USE PLAN hint, does not exist. Specify an existing index, or create an index with the specified name.

21561	1033	16	0	The value specified for parameter %s = %d is not valid. 
21564	1033	16	0	The table %s contains the column msrepl_tran_version, which is used by replication. The column is set to NULL, but it must be set to NOT NULL. Replication failed to alter this column, so you must drop the column and then add the table as an article again using sp_addarticle. Replication will then add the column to the table.
21567	1033	16	0	The call format VCALL cannot be used for the specified article. VCALL format can be used only for articles in publications that allow updating subscriptions. If you do not require updating subscriptions, specify a different call format. If you do require updating subscriptions, you must drop the publication and re-create it to specify that updating subscriptions are allowed.
21569	1033	16	0	The article %s in the publication %s does not have a valid conflict table entry in the system table sysarticleupdates. This entry is required for publications that allow queued updating subscriptions. Check for errors in the last run of the Snapshot Agent.
21570	1033	16	0	Cannot create the logical record relationship. Table '%s' does not have a foreign key referencing table '%s'. A logical record relationship requires a foreign key relationship between the parent and child tables.

21573	1033	16	0	Cannot add a logical record relationship because the foreign key constraint '%s' on table '%s' is defined with the NOT FOR REPLICATION option. To add the logical record relationship, first drop the foreign key constraint, and then re-create it without the NOT FOR REPLICATION option.
21574	1033	16	0	Cannot add a logical record relationship because the article '%s' is published in publication '%s', which has a compatibility level lower than 90RTM. Use sp_changemergepublication to set the publication_compatibility_level to 90RTM.
21575	1033	16	0	The value specified for the property filter_type is not valid. Valid values are 1 (join filter only), 2 (logical record relation only), and 3 (join filter and logical record relation).
21576	1033	16	0	Cannot add a logical record relationship between tables '%s' and '%s' because the foreign key column '%s' in table '%s' allows NULL values. Alter the column to disallow NULL values.
21578	1033	16	0	In order to use partition_options of 2 (non overlapping partitions with multiple subscriptions per partition) or 3 (non overlapping partitions one subscription per partition) the publication '%s' must be enabled to use partition groups functionality. Use sp_changemergepublication to set 'use_partition_groups' to 'true'.
21579	1033	16	0	Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of  2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article is involved in multiple join filters.

21580	1033	16	0	Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of  2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article is involved in both a row filter and a join filter. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter; drop the join filter by using sp_dropmergefilter; or change the row filter by using sp_changemergepublication.
21581	1033	16	0	Article "%s" in publication "%s" does not qualify for the partition option that you specified. You cannot specify a value of  2 or 3 (nonoverlapping partitions) for the @partition_options parameter because the article has a join filter with a join_unique_key value of 0. Either select a value of 0 or 1 for the @partition_options parameter, or use sp_changemergefilter to specify a value of 1 for join_unique_key.

30092	1033	16	0	Full-text stoplist ID '%d' does not exist.
30093	1033	17	0	The SQL Server word-breaking client failed to initialize. This might be because a filter daemon host process is not in a valid state. This can prevent SQL Server from initializing critical system objects. Full-text queries will fail until this issue is resolved. Try stopping SQL Server and any filter daemon host processes and then restarting the instance of SQL Server.
30094	1033	17	0	The full-text indexing pipeline could not be initialized. This might be because the resources on the system are too low to allocate memory or create tasks. Try restarting the instance of SQL Server.
30095	1033	10	0	The version of the language components used by full-text catalog '%ls' in database '%ls' is different from the version of the language components included this version of SQL Server.
